# Hands Free Presentation
Hack at Code Day Bay Area to read speech 

This project listens to you while giving a presentation, and when you say the trigger words, "next slide" or "previous slide" will advance the presentation to the desired slide.

Using the Snowboy always listening API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy), we use hotword detection to que the action to the slide.
